LPCG Options:

**endOfStanzaMarker**: This string will be added at the end of the last line of each stanza. It should normally begin with a space so it isnâ€™t squashed against the end of the last word on the line.

**endOfTextMarker**: Like *endOfStanzaMarker*, but appears at the end of the last line of the entire text.
